## Hi, I'm Emma!
I am a game developer at heart, but I am mainly branching off and expanding my programming horizons.
Currently, I am working on a game engine, and I am also avaliable for commissions, if you want, you can ask me about it on my discord, `emmaqwe`.
Be sure to check in on BAM! Engine, as it is a really big project, and any help is wanted and appreciated. You can see the site here: https://emma1-png.github.io/BAM-Engine.
If you are just wanting to chat and have a good time, I am willing to on discord.




My current programming skills are:
`Python` https://python.org, `C#` https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp, `Scratch` https://scratch.mit.edu
It is unofficial, but I am learning & developing `E`, you can see the examples, along with the compiler (in private development) on the github repository: https://github.com/Emma1-png/BAM! Engine
